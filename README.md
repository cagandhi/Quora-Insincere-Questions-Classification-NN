# Quora-Insincere-Questions-Classification-NN
A 2-layer Bidirectional LSTM based model to classify a Quora question as insincere or not. This was my project in "ECE 542: Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course at NC State University.

The data and embeddings file can be found on the Kaggle challenge Data Page here: [QIQC Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data/).

The complete details for the data, our approach along with the results can be found in the Presentation here and in the Project Report here.
