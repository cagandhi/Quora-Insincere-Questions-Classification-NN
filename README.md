# Quora-Insincere-Questions-Classification-NN
A 2-layer Bidirectional LSTM based model to classify a Quora question as insincere or not. This was my project in "ECE 542: Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course at NC State University.

The Kaggle submission notebook can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/chintan23/qiqcscript?scriptVersionId=32825369). The output directory in the kernel also contains the model weights, loaded embeddings and the padded text vectors files.

## Dataset

The data and embeddings file can be found on the Kaggle challenge Data Page here: [QIQC Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data/).

## Methodology
The complete details for the approaches used along with the results can be found in the [Presentation](ECE542_Final_Project_Presentation.pdf) and the [Project Report](ECE542_Final_Project_Report.pdf) in the repository.
