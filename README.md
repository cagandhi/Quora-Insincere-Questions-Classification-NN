# Quora-Insincere-Questions-Classification-NN
A 2-layer Bidirectional LSTM based model to classify a Quora question as insincere or not. This was my project in "ECE 542: Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course.

This project is for the Kaggle QIQC challenge found at: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/).
